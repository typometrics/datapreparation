The non-transitory computer-readable medium of claim 14, further comprising instructions that when executed cause the processor to:\nprovide a first instruction associated with displaying the scrollable refresh trigger based on the scroll command; and\nprovide a second instruction associated with activating the scrollable refresh trigger in response to determination that the scrollable refresh trigger is fully displayed.\n\n18. The non-transitory computer-readable medium of claim 14, further comprising instructions that when executed cause the processor to:\ndetermine that the scrollable refresh trigger has been activated in response to a determination that the scroll command was completed while the scrollable refresh trigger was fully displayed.\n\n19. The non-transitory computer-readable medium of claim 14, further comprising instructions that when executed cause the processor to:\nautomatically scroll the scrollable list of content items such that the scrollable refresh trigger is not displayed in response to determining that a refresh operation has completed.\n\n20. The non-transitory computer-readable medium of claim 14, further comprising instructions that when executed cause the processor to:\nprovide first audio feedback in response to displaying the scrollable refresh trigger; and\nprovide second audio feedback in response to determining that the scrollable refresh trigger has been activated.
